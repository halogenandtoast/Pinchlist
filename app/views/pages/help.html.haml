    %h3 Using Listwerk
    %dl
      %dt Create lists
      %dd Type a list name into the "New List" input and press the ENTER key.

      %dt Create tasks 
      %dd Type your task into the input below a list title, then press ENTER.

      %dt Sort lists and tasks
      %dd Drag and drop them into the desired order.

      %dt Complete a task 
      %dd Just click on the task (you must click on the text â€” whitespace around the text is reserved for dragging). tasks will stay on your list for 7 days after they are completed; then they'll be archived.

      %dt Edit a task 
      %dd Double-click on the task; press ENTER when you're done editing.

      %dt Give a task a due date 
      %dd Type the date with the "@" prefix along with your task. Try "@mm/dd", @monday, @wed, @tomorrow. Tasks that have due dates will also appear in the Upcoming list in chronological order. You can edit and complete them in this list as well.

      %dt Customize list colors 
      %dd Hover over a list title and click on the color icon that appears to the right. Click a swatch or type a Hex value.

      %dt Delete a list 
      %dd Click the X icon to the right of the list title.

      %dt Delete a task
      %dd Edit the task, delete all of its text, then press ENTER.

      %dt View archived tasks 
      %dd Click the "View all" link at the bottom of a list.

      %dt Scroll horizontally
      %dd If your lists are wider than the window, use the "j" and "k" keys to scroll left and right. Most browsers will also scroll horizontally if you hold the SHIFT key while using yor mouse's scrollwheel. 

      %dt Nest lists
      %dd Listwerk doesn't support nested lists because we think it buries information. But, you can create a new list, drag it next to the parent and give it a similar color...works for us!
