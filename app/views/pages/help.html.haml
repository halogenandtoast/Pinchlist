    %h3 How to use Listwerk
    %ul
      %li Add lists by typing into the "New List" input and pressing the ENTER key.
      %li Same goes for adding tasks (except you'll use the input within that list).
      %li Drag and drop your lists and tasks into the desired order.
      %li Click on a task name to complete the task. Tasks will stay on your list for 7 days after they are completed; then they'll be archived.
      %li Double-click on task name to edit the task. Press ENTER when you're done editing.
      %li Use the "@" prefix to give your tasks a due date. Try "@mm/dd", @monday, @wed, @tomorrow, and more...
      %li Tasks that have due dates will also appear in the Upcoming list in chronological order. You can edit and complete them in this list as well.
      %li The date to the right of the "Upcoming" title is today's date.
      %li Customize your list colors by hovering over the list title and clicking on the color icon that appears to the right. Click a swatch or input a Hex value.
      %li Delete a list by clicking the X icon to the right of the list title.
      %li Delete a task by editing the task, deleting all of it's text, and pressing ENTER.
