  Dude!

  Ben and Matt here.

  So, we've been working on this web application, and if you're interested, we'd love for you to try it out and give us your thoughts. It's called Listwerk, and it's basically a personal task manager, but we think it's pretty nifty. You can accept the invitation and start using the app by clicking the link below.
%p= link_to 'Accept invitation', accept_invitation_url(@resource, :invitation_token => @resource.invitation_token)
%p
  If you have questions, comments, complaints, or ideas, you can email us at:
%br
  ben@listwerk.com
  matt@listwerk.com or
  support@listwerk.com
%p
  Or, you can just contact us however you normally do.
%p
  If you don't want to accept the invitation, please ignore this email.

  Your account won't be created until you access the link above and set your password.
